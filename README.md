(NOTE: This is the source files only. The project was way too big to upload in its entirety, apparently.)

This is an Android (Java) app.

It was a school project for a course that required a college term/course/assessment tracking Android application.

It is not thread-safe and does not utilize modern methods such as Room. Some functionality (issuing of alerts, specifically) is not compatible with Android 9.

Thanks for checking out my code!
